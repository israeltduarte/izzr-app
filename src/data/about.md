# About
I'm Israel Duarte, a web developer based in Campinas, Brazil.    

Since 2019 I've been participating and helping engineering teams to plan, design, implement and maintain high performance web systems. While I'm not coding or studying I'll be probably eating, cooking or working out but not exactly in that order.

# Intro

I am a co-founder and the CTO of [Arthena](https://arthena.com) where I build tools to price fine art quickly, accurately, and at scale. I also advise startups, and I invest in people and ideas through a [small venture fund](https://skepticalinvestments.biz). I am particularly interested in projects that touch health and safety, imaging, social impact, and aerospace. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At Arthena, I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models with technologies like [Dask](https://dask.org/), [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). I primarily work as a data engineer but have broad experience across Arthenaâ€™s stack.
