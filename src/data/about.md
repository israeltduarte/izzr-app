# About
I'm Israel Duarte, a web developer based in Campinas, Brazil.    

Since 2019 I've been participating and helping engineering teams to plan, design, implement and maintain high performance web systems. While I'm not coding or studying I'll be probably eating, cooking or working out but not exactly in that order.
